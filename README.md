Chat application
Your objective is to create a simple (but not shabby) React or React Native chat application which should include 3 views: Login, Chat & Profile, while at the same time impressing us with how simple and clean your code is.

Requirements
Login view / screen
Login window for user with basic login information email & password
Once a user inputs any details he will be redirected to chat view
No server logic is required here

Chat view / screen
Chat window with sidebar / top bar for multiple chats and chat box;
In chat box user is able to send and read messages;
Create a JSON at https://jsonbin.io API (or any other mock json API) which contains mock messages;
Once a user enters the chat, fetch messages from the API and render in the chat view;
Basic implementation - once a user clicks the “Send” button or presses enter - message appears in chat;
Keep API up to date with new messages;

Profile view / screen
Create a view to edit basic profile details
No server logic is required here

Implementation
Depending on your preference, create a React web or React Native (if you’re feeling adventurous) application:
Please use create-react-app for React web application;
Or react-native init for React Native application.
Of course, write your code in Javascript or Typescript (again, if you’re feeling brave enough, although there is really no need for that);

Evaluating your solution
Your solution will be evaluated against the following criteria:
We were able to easily build and run your code on macOS;
Code quality - is your code clean, simple, commented, modern, well architectured;
User experience - how simple, intuitive and clear the application is to use;
User interface - make sure you're using a good layout, responsive, simple/modern colors. It's best to stick with current standards;
Error handling - your code should handle potential errors and loading states gracefully;

Submission
Place your code on private Github repo and add lukebars as a reviewer;
We don't want to see any binaries, or other things you wouldn't check into version control, so keep your repo clean;
Make sure your code is without lint errors, well formatted and easy to read;

If you want to go extra mile
Here’s some bonus tasks:
Option for disappearing messages
Scroll down on new messages
Ability to create new chats
Well thought-out UX
